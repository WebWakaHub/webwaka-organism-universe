# ORGANISM GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

---

## I. Purpose of Governance

### Why the Organism Requires Governance

The Organism is a constitutionally self-regulating, evolving, multi-system platform entity. Without formal governance mechanisms, the Organism would be vulnerable to structural drift, silent mutation, and uncontrolled domain explosion.

Governance ensures that the Organism evolves in a controlled, auditable, and constitutionally compliant manner while preserving the structural integrity of all lower layers.

### What Governance Prevents

- **Structural drift:** Unauthorized deviation from constitutional invariants
- **Silent mutation:** Unratified changes to layer definitions or System boundaries
- **Domain explosion:** Uncontrolled proliferation of Systems without coherence validation
- **Invariant violation:** Bypass or redefinition of lower-layer structural rules
- **Constitutional erosion:** Gradual weakening of architectural foundations

### Relationship to ORGANISM_LAYER_CONSTITUTION.md

This Governance Framework operationalizes the constitutional principles defined in ORGANISM_LAYER_CONSTITUTION.md. The Constitution defines what the Organism is and its structural invariants. This Framework defines how the Organism governs itself to maintain constitutional compliance.

## II. System Admission Protocol

### Mandatory Requirements

Before any new System can be added to the Organism, it must satisfy the following requirements:

- Must assemble existing Organs
- Must pass domain coherence validation
- Must pass structural audit
- Must not duplicate existing System
- Must not merge unrelated domains
- Must not bypass Tissue abstraction
- Must receive Founder ratification

### Formal Steps

**1. Proposal**  
A formal proposal document must be submitted defining the System's purpose, Organ composition, domain scope, and structural justification.

**2. Structural Review**  
The proposal undergoes structural review to validate domain coherence, Organ composition, and alignment with existing Systems.

**3. Audit**  
A formal structural audit is conducted to verify that the proposed System does not violate any constitutional invariants, does not duplicate existing Systems, and does not create domain overlap.

**4. Compatibility Check**  
The proposed System is evaluated for compatibility with existing Systems, ensuring no boundary conflicts or responsibility overlaps.

**5. Ratification**  
The Founder reviews the proposal, structural review, audit results, and compatibility analysis, and issues a ratification decision.

**6. Registration**  
Upon ratification, the System is formally registered in the Organism's System registry and becomes part of the constitutional platform entity.

## III. System Deprecation Protocol

### Conditions for Deprecation

A System may be deprecated under the following conditions:

- The System's domain is no longer relevant to the Organism's purpose
- The System has been superseded by a more coherent System composition
- The System violates constitutional invariants and cannot be remediated
- The System creates unresolvable conflicts with other Systems

### Compatibility Guarantees

Deprecation of a System must not break existing dependencies. All dependent Systems must be migrated or refactored before deprecation is finalized.

### Migration Requirements

A formal migration plan must be provided, detailing how existing functionality will be preserved, how dependent Systems will be updated, and what timeline will be followed.

### Sunset Timeline Enforcement

A deprecation timeline must be established and enforced. No System may be removed without adequate notice and migration support.

### Cross-System Impact Analysis

A comprehensive impact analysis must be conducted to identify all Systems, Organs, Tissues, Cells, and Organelles affected by the deprecation.

### Ratification Requirement

All System deprecations require Founder ratification. No silent removal permitted.

---

## IV. Constitutional Amendment Process

### What Requires Amendment

The following changes require constitutional amendment:

- Modification of structural invariants at any layer
- Addition or removal of Organelle categories
- Redefinition of Cell, Tissue, Organ, or System semantics
- Changes to governance protocols
- Modification of ratification authority

### What Cannot Be Amended

The following are immutable without Founder-level constitutional override:

- The biological layer hierarchy (Organelle → Cell → Tissue → Organ → System → Organism)
- The 18 canonical Organelle categories
- The bottom-up composition principle
- The prohibition on upward redefinition of lower layers

### Audit Requirements

All constitutional amendments require:

- Formal structural audit
- Backward compatibility validation
- Cross-layer impact analysis
- Invariant preservation verification

### Ratification Authority

All constitutional amendments require Founder ratification. No amendment may be enacted without explicit Founder approval.

### Immutable Structural Invariants

Organelle Categories are not amendable without Founder-level constitutional override. The 18 canonical categories represent the foundational primitive domains of the platform and are structurally immutable.

---

## V. Cross-System Conflict Resolution

### Domain Boundary Disputes

When two Systems claim overlapping domain responsibility, a formal domain boundary analysis is conducted to determine the correct allocation of responsibility based on Organ composition and domain coherence.

### Responsibility Overlap

Systems must not have overlapping responsibilities. When overlap is detected, one System must be refactored to eliminate the overlap, or a new System must be created to unify the overlapping domain.

### Capability Duplication

Systems must not duplicate capabilities. When duplication is detected, the duplicated capability must be extracted into a shared Organ or Tissue, or one System must be deprecated.

### Escalation Mechanism

Conflicts that cannot be resolved through structural analysis are escalated to Founder arbitration.

### Founder Arbitration Authority

The Founder has final authority to resolve all cross-System conflicts. Founder decisions are binding and constitute constitutional precedent.

**No System may redefine another System's Organ boundary.**

## VI. AI Agent Operational Authority Model

### Role Boundaries

AI agents operate within defined role boundaries. Agents may execute tasks, generate artifacts, and perform operations within their assigned scope, but may not exceed their constitutional authority.

### Separation of Execution Powers

Execution powers are separated to prevent unilateral structural mutation. No single agent may both propose and ratify constitutional changes.

### Double-Verification Requirement

All structural changes require double-verification: one agent proposes, another verifies, and the Founder ratifies.

### No Unilateral Structural Mutation

AI agents cannot unilaterally modify sealed layers, introduce new categories, merge Systems, redefine Organ boundaries, or change invariants.

### Task Traceability

All agent operations must be traceable. Every structural change must be documented with clear attribution, rationale, and audit trail.

### Constitutional Compliance Obligation

AI agents are constitutionally obligated to preserve all lower-layer invariants and operate within the governance framework.

### Explicit Prohibitions

Agents cannot, without ratified amendment:

- Modify sealed layers
- Introduce new categories
- Merge Systems
- Redefine Organ boundaries
- Change invariants

---

## VII. Structural Enforcement & Audit Mechanism

### Mandatory Audit Cadence

Structural audits must be conducted:

- Before any System admission
- Before any System deprecation
- Before any constitutional amendment
- Periodically to detect structural drift

### Layer Integrity Validation

Each audit must validate the integrity of all layers, ensuring that:

- Organelle categories remain unchanged
- Cell compositions respect Organelle boundaries
- Tissue compositions respect Cell boundaries
- Organ compositions respect Tissue boundaries
- System compositions respect Organ boundaries
- Organism governance respects System boundaries

### Structural Drift Detection

Audits must detect and report any structural drift, including:

- Unauthorized layer modifications
- Invariant violations
- Domain boundary erosion
- Silent mutations

### Violation Handling Procedure

When violations are detected:

1. Document the violation
2. Assess impact on constitutional integrity
3. Propose remediation
4. Execute remediation with Founder approval
5. Update audit records

### Escalation Protocol

Violations that cannot be remediated through standard procedures are escalated to Founder review for constitutional intervention.

## VIII. Version Evolution Control

### Versioning Model Across Layers

The Organism employs a hierarchical versioning model:

- Organelle Layer: Immutable (version 1.0 permanent)
- Cell Layer: Additive only (new Cells may be added, existing Cells may not be removed)
- Tissue Layer: Additive only (new Tissues may be added, existing Tissues may not be removed)
- Organ Layer: Additive only (new Organs may be added with amendment)
- System Layer: Managed evolution (Systems may be added or deprecated with protocol compliance)
- Organism Layer: Governance evolution (governance may evolve with constitutional amendment)

### Compatibility Contracts

All layers must maintain backward compatibility. No breaking changes are permitted without constitutional amendment and migration plan.

### System Upgrade Rules

Systems may evolve through:

- Addition of new Organs (with audit)
- Refactoring of Organ composition (with compatibility preservation)
- Deprecation of obsolete Systems (with migration plan)

### Backward Compatibility Protection

No change may break existing dependencies. All evolution must preserve backward compatibility or provide explicit migration paths.

**No breaking change without audit + ratification.**

---

## IX. Invariant Protection Declaration

### All Lower-Layer Invariants Remain Binding

The Organism is bound by all structural invariants defined in lower layers:

- Organelle Layer invariants
- Cell Layer invariants
- Tissue Layer invariants
- Organ Layer invariants
- System Layer invariants

### No Upward Override Permitted

Higher layers may not override or redefine lower-layer invariants. The Organism cannot change the rules of Systems, Organs, Tissues, Cells, or Organelles.

### Organism Cannot Redefine Lower-Layer Mechanics

The Organism governs Systems but does not redefine:

- Organelle categories or behavior
- Cell composition rules
- Tissue coordination mechanics
- Organ domain boundaries
- System assembly principles

### Structural Invariants Are Supreme

Constitutional structural invariants are supreme and binding across all layers. No governance decision, System admission, or evolution may violate structural invariants.
