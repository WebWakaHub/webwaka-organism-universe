# ORGANISM EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

---

## I. Purpose of Execution Binding

### Why Governance Must Bind Execution

Constitutional governance without execution binding results in structural drift. Governance defines rules, but execution determines whether those rules are enforced. Without binding governance to execution mechanics, the Organism cannot maintain constitutional integrity.

### Why GitHub Is the Canonical Operational Surface

GitHub provides version control, audit trails, collaborative workflows, and structured change management. These capabilities are essential for maintaining constitutional compliance in a distributed, multi-agent environment. GitHub is the operational surface where constitutional governance is enforced.

### Why AI Agents Must Be Constrained

AI agents are powerful execution engines capable of rapid structural mutation. Without constitutional constraints, agents may inadvertently violate invariants, introduce domain drift, or bypass governance protocols. Constraints ensure agents operate within constitutional boundaries.

### Why Tasks Must Map to Biological Layers

Tasks that do not map to biological layers risk creating architectural ambiguity, cross-layer contamination, and structural incoherence. Every task must be explicitly bound to a layer to ensure constitutional compliance.

**Declaration:**

Architecture without execution binding results in structural drift.

## II. Repository-to-Layer Mapping Model

### Canonical Rule

Each biological layer maps to a repository universe.

### Explicit Mapping

- **webwaka-organelle-universe** → Organelle Layer
- **webwaka-cell-universe** → Cell Layer
- **webwaka-tissue-universe** → Tissue Layer
- **webwaka-organ-universe** → Organ Layer
- **webwaka-system-universe** → System Layer
- **webwaka-organism-universe** → Organism Layer

### Structural Rules

- **No cross-layer file placement:** Files belonging to one layer may not be placed in another layer's repository
- **No mixed-layer repositories:** A single repository may not contain artifacts from multiple layers
- **No architectural collapse:** Layers may not be merged or collapsed into unified repositories
- **No renaming of layer repositories:** Repository names are constitutionally fixed and may not be changed without Founder-level amendment

## III. GitHub Issue Taxonomy Model

### Mandatory Issue Structure

Every issue must include:

- **Layer designation:** Organelle / Cell / Tissue / Organ / System / Organism
- **Category reference:** If applicable, reference to the relevant Organelle category or domain
- **Structural justification:** Explanation of why the issue is necessary and how it aligns with constitutional principles
- **Impacted invariants:** Identification of any structural invariants affected by the issue
- **Audit requirement flag:** Indication of whether the issue requires formal structural audit
- **Required verifying agent:** Designation of which agent must verify the work

### Issue Labeling System

**Layer Labels:**

- `layer:organelle`
- `layer:cell`
- `layer:tissue`
- `layer:organ`
- `layer:system`
- `layer:organism`

**Type Labels:**

- `type:constitution` — Constitutional document creation or amendment
- `type:audit` — Structural audit or compliance verification
- `type:implementation` — Implementation of ratified structures
- `type:amendment` — Formal amendment proposal
- `type:admission` — System admission proposal
- `type:deprecation` — System deprecation proposal

## IV. Manus Agent Role Authority Model

### Agent Role Definitions

**webwaka007 — Founder**  
Final Ratification Authority. Approves all constitutional amendments, System admissions, domain modifications, and layer invariant changes.

**webwakaagent1 — Governance Control**  
Oversees governance compliance, manages constitutional processes, and coordinates cross-agent workflows.

**webwakaagent3 — Architecture Verification**  
Verifies architectural integrity, validates structural compliance, and ensures layer boundaries are preserved.

**webwakaagent4 — Implementation**  
Executes implementation tasks within constitutional boundaries, following ratified structures.

**webwakaagent5 — Structural Audit**  
Conducts formal structural audits, detects drift, and validates invariant compliance.

**webwakaagent6 — Release Validation**  
Validates releases for constitutional compliance, backward compatibility, and structural integrity.

### Agent Constraints

- **No agent may mutate sealed layers unilaterally:** All changes to sealed layers require double-verification and Founder approval
- **Double-verification required before merge:** One agent proposes, another verifies, before merge is permitted
- **Founder approval required for:**
  - Constitutional amendment
  - New System admission
  - Domain modification
  - Layer invariant change

---

## V. Pull Request Constitutional Gate Model

### Mandatory PR Checks

Every Pull Request must:

1. **Declare impacted layer:** Explicitly state which layer is affected
2. **Declare impacted invariants:** Identify any structural invariants that may be affected
3. **Confirm no cross-layer violation:** Verify that the change does not violate layer boundaries
4. **Confirm no category mutation:** Verify that no Organelle categories or domain boundaries are redefined
5. **Pass structural audit:** Complete formal audit if required
6. **Pass secondary agent verification:** Obtain verification from designated verifying agent
7. **Pass Founder ratification if required:** Obtain Founder approval for constitutional changes

### PR Template Requirements

Every PR must include:

- **Structural Impact Statement:** Description of how the change affects the architectural structure
- **Drift Risk Assessment:** Evaluation of whether the change introduces structural drift
- **Invariant Compliance Declaration:** Explicit statement that all relevant invariants are preserved

---

## VI. Structural Drift Detection Protocol

### Audit Cycle

- **Quarterly structural audit cycle:** Formal audits conducted every quarter to detect drift
- **Mandatory invariant validation:** All structural invariants validated during each audit
- **Cross-system duplication detection:** Audits detect and report any duplicated capabilities across Systems
- **Domain explosion monitoring:** Audits monitor for uncontrolled proliferation of domains or Systems
- **AI-generated content review enforcement:** All AI-generated structural content reviewed for constitutional compliance

### Violation Handling

When structural violations are detected:

1. **Immediate freeze:** The affected repository or branch is frozen
2. **Audit:** A formal audit is conducted to assess the violation
3. **Rollback:** If necessary, changes are rolled back to the last compliant state
4. **Constitutional review:** The violation is reviewed for constitutional implications and remediation

---

## VII. CI/CD Constitutional Enforcement

### Future Pipeline Requirements

The following checks will be implemented in CI/CD pipelines:

- **Layer validation check:** Validates that files are placed in the correct layer repository
- **Repository location validation:** Validates that repositories follow the canonical naming and structure
- **Naming compliance check:** Validates that naming conventions are followed
- **Invariant scanner:** Scans for potential invariant violations
- **Unauthorized layer modification detection:** Detects attempts to modify sealed layers without authorization

**Note:** This section defines framework requirements only. No implementation code is provided.

---

## VIII. Version Evolution Governance

### Hierarchical Versioning

Each layer maintains its own version:

- **Organelle version:** Immutable (1.0 permanent)
- **Cell version:** Additive evolution only
- **Tissue version:** Additive evolution only
- **Organ version:** Additive evolution with amendment
- **System version:** Managed evolution with admission/deprecation protocols
- **Organism version:** Governance evolution with constitutional amendment

### Evolution Rules

- **No breaking changes without audit:** All breaking changes require formal structural audit and ratification
- **Backward compatibility requirement:** All changes must preserve backward compatibility or provide explicit migration paths
- **Migration policy enforcement:** Deprecations must include migration plans and timelines

---

## IX. AI Agent Execution Constraints

### Prohibited Actions

AI agents may not:

- Generate new Organelle categories
- Rename domains or layers
- Collapse layers or merge repositories
- Modify sealed constitutional documents without ratification
- Bypass governance protocols

### Mandatory Execution Requirements

AI agents must:

- Read relevant constitutional documents before execution
- Cite document sections used in their work
- Operate within assigned role boundaries
- Submit work for verification before merge

### Mandatory Execution Checklist

Before executing any structural task, AI agents must:

1. **Identify layer:** Determine which layer the task affects
2. **Identify invariants:** Identify all relevant structural invariants
3. **Verify no cross-layer violation:** Confirm the task does not violate layer boundaries
4. **Declare structural impact:** Document the structural impact of the task
5. **Submit for verification:** Submit work to designated verifying agent
